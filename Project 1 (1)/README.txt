Khalid's Contributions:
Created the Rectangle class 
Created a portion of the getters and setters in the Triangle class
Worked on the recursion of the shapes(The base case , recursive techniques as well as the colors used)
Worked on fixing the issues we ran into when running the code




Hamza's Contributions:
Created the Circle class
Created a portion of the getters and setters in the Triangle class
Worked on the math used on the recursion of the shapes, (where & how much of the width/height or radius the x axis and y axis would be shifted)
Created the README text file



How to compile Circle.java - Run javac Circle.java in the terminal
How to compile Triangle.java - Run javac Triangle.java in the terminal
How to compile Rectangle.java - Run javac Rectangle.java in the terminal
How to compile FractalDrawer.java - Run javac FractalDrawer.java in the terminal

How to run all files - Compile all the mentioned Class files and FractalDrawer file above, then run the FractalDrawer.java in the terminal

No Additional features thats is implemented in the program
